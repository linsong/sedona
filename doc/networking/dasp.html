<h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>
<!-- /////////////////////////////////////////////////////// -->

<p>
This document specifies the Datagram Authenticated Session Protocol or DASP.
This protocol is designed to provide an unordered, reliable, secure session for
full-duplex datagram exchange that can be implemented for low power wireless
networks and low cost devices. Specifically we target networks that include
6LoWPAN. These networks are typically comprised of devices without the
resources to run a protocol such as TCP and must implement their protocol stacks
in under 100KB of memory.
</p>

<!-- /////////////////////////////////////////////////////// -->
<h1 id="requirements">Requirements</h1>
<!-- /////////////////////////////////////////////////////// -->

<p>
The following requirements dictate the design of DASP:
</p>

<ol>

<li>DASP runs over an unordered, unreliable packet based transport layer, which
is assumed to be UDP or provide the same functionality.</li>

<li>DASP will be a datagram oriented protocol, not a stream oriented protocol.
Datagram boundaries will be maintained.</li>

<li>DASP will deliver datagrams reliably with associated retries. Datagrams are
guaranteed to be delivered exactly once.</li>

<li>DASP will not guarantee delivery of datagrams in order. Because DASP is
designed to run on devices with limited RAM resources, we must assume that
buffer space is extremely scarce. Any ordering of datagrams is the
responsibility of the application layer.</li>

<li>DASP datagrams are delivered within the context of a session. Sessions
allow us to efficiently associate datagrams with application context.
Application context might include user account privileges, eventing state, or
the state associated with a file transfer.</li>

<li>DASP sessions are full-duplex - either endpoint may initiate a datagram.</li>

<li>DASP sessions are established by authenticating a username and password.
However the term password is loosely defined to include any type of secret key.</li>

<li>DASP session setup will include an extensible mechanism for negotiating the
cryptography capabilities of the two endpoints. The protocol will support
plugging in new cryptography standards, but standardizes on SHA-1 for message
digest. Version 1.0 does not specify encryption, but could be added via new
handshaking headers.</li>

<li>DASP will provide flow control in the delivery of datagrams between the
endpoints using a sliding window. For example, a session might span both a 
high speed network such as Ethernet and a low speed network such
as 6LoWPAN running over 802.15.4. Compounding the problem is that low speed
networks may have few memory resources to allocate to buffering and can
quickly be overwhelmed by bursts of packets.</li>

</ol>

<!-- /////////////////////////////////////////////////////// -->
<h1 id="design">Design</h1>
<!-- /////////////////////////////////////////////////////// -->

<p>
A DASP session is established when a client initiates a connection to a server.
The two endpoints exchange a set of messages called the <i>handshake</i> to
establish or reject the session. Once a session is established it is assigned
an unsigned 16-bit identifier called the <i>sessionId</i>. The sessionId is
included in all subsequent messaging within the context of that session.
Messages within the session are consecutively numbered with an unsigned 16-bit
value, which we call the <i>sequence number</i> or <i>seqNum</i>. Each endpoint
of the session maintains its own sequence and sliding window of outstanding
datagrams. This sliding window is used to implement reliability and flow
control. Sessions are terminated explicitly via a special control message, or
may be timed out after a period where no messages have been received from the
remote endpoint.
</p>

<!-- /////////////////////////////////////////////////////// -->
<h1 id="messageFormat">Message Format</h1>
<!-- /////////////////////////////////////////////////////// -->

<p>
DASP messages are described as a data structure using the following primitive types:
</p>

<ul>
<li><b>u1</b>:  an unsigned 8-bit integer</li>
<li><b>u2</b>: an unsigned 16-bit integer in network byte order</li>
<li><b>str</b>: UTF-8 encoded text, followed by a null terminate (zero) byte</li>
<li><b>bytes</b>: an unsigned 8-bit length n, followed by n bytes</li>
<li><b>x[ ]</b>: an array of type x that contains zero or more elements</li>
</ul>

<p>
All DASP messages are formatted as follows:
</p>

<pre>
message
{
  u2      sessionId
  u2      seqNum
  u1      high 4-bits msgType, low 4-bits numFields
  field[] headerFields
  u1[]    payload
}
</pre>

<p>
The data in the message is summarized:
</p>

<ul>
<li><b>sessionId</b>: identifies the session associated with the message.
During the handshake before a sessionId is allocated, the value 0xffff is used.</li>

<li><b>seqNum</b>: used to sequence each DATAGRAM message for management of the sliding
window and matching up requests/responses.  Each endpoint maintains its own
sequence numbers.</li>

<li><b>msgType</b>: 4-bits are used to identity how to handle the message from
an DASP perspective. The list of message types are detailed in a separate section
below.</li>

<li><b>numFields</b>: 4-bits specify how many header fields follow in the
message.</li>

<li><b>headerFields</b>: a list of zero or more fields that carry additional
data about the request much like HTTP header fields. Header fields are detailed
in a separate section below.</li>

<li><b>payload</b>: zero or more bytes of message payload. A DASP message does not
specify the payload size, but assumes that the underlying transport such as UDP
provides the total size of the entire message from which payload size can be
computed.</li>
</ul>

<!-- /////////////////////////////////////////////////////// -->
<h1 id="messageTypes">Message Types</h1>
<!-- /////////////////////////////////////////////////////// -->

<p>
The following table specifies the full list of message type identifiers:
</p>

<table>
<tr><th>Id</th><th>Name</th><th>Description</th></tr>
<tr><td>0x0</td><td>discover</td><td>Sent by client or server during device discovery process</td></tr>
<tr><td>0x1</td><td>hello</td><td>Sent by client to initiate handshake</td></tr>

<tr><td>0x7</td><td>close</td><td>Close the session</td></tr>
</table>

<!-- /////////////////////////////////////////////////////// -->
<h1 id="headerFields">Header Fields</h1>
<!-- /////////////////////////////////////////////////////// -->

<p>
Header fields define a generic way to include an arbitrary set of name/value
pairs in an DASP header. They are used much like HTTP header fields - each
message type defines required and optional header fields and how they are to be
interpreted. Additional header fields can be added to future versions of this
specification without breaking the generic processing of DASP messages.
</p>

<p>
Header fields are prefixed with a one byte headerId. The headerId conveys the
name of the header in the high 6 bits and the value type of the header in the
bottom 2 bits. Implementations can always look at the least significant 2-bits
of the headerIds to determine how to decode or skip the header value.
Implementations must ignore unknown headers. The 2-bit value type identifiers:
</p>

<table>
<tr><th>Id</th><th>Name</th><th>Encoding</th></tr>
<tr><td>0x0</td><td>nil</td><td>The header has no value - the header itself indicates a boolean</td></tr>
<tr><td>0x1</td><td>u2</td><td>Unsigned 16-bit integer in network byte order</td></tr>
<tr><td>0x2</td><td>str</td><td>UTF-8 encoded text string, followed by null terminator (zero) byte</td></tr>
<tr><td>0x3</td><td>bytes</td><td>8-bit length, followed by string of raw bytes</td></tr>
</table>

<p>
Header fields may be specified in any order. Implementations must never assume
a specific order.

</table>

<!-- /////////////////////////////////////////////////////// -->
<h1 id="handshake">Handshake</h1>
<!-- /////////////////////////////////////////////////////// -->

<p>
A session is established by a series of messages called the handshake:
</p>

<ol>
<li>The client sends the server a hello message</li>
<li>The server responds with the challenge, welcome, or close message</li>
<li>The client responds with the authenticate or close message</li>
<li>The server responds with either a welcome or close message</li>
</ol>

<p>
Once the client receives the welcome message from either step 2 or step 4, then
the session is established. An close message during any step terminates the
handshake.
</p>

<h2 id="hello">Hello</h2>

<p>
The hello message is sent by a client to initiate a session. The following
header fields apply:
</p>

<ul>
<li><b>version</b> (required): specifies the protocol version to be used. The
version of this specification is 1.0, which is represented as 0x0100 in a 16-bit
unsigned integer.</li>

<li><b>remoteId</b> (required): the client side sessionId used for messages
sent by the server to the client.</li>

<li><b>idealMax</b> (optional): the ideal maximum of bytes per message from the
client perspective - see Tuning. If not specified 512 is assumed.</li>

<li><b>absMax</b> (optional): the absolute maximum of bytes per message from
the client perspective - see Tuning. If not specified 512 is assumed.</li>

<li><b>receiveMax</b> (optional): the absolute maximum size of the client's
receiving windowing (number of messages). If not specified, then a window size
of 31 messages is assumed.</li>

<li><b>receiveTimeout</b> (optional): the number of seconds that may elapse
without receiving a message before the session is timed out from client
perspective; if not specified then a default of 30 seconds is assumed.</li>
</ul>

<p>
The sessionId of a hello message must be set to 0xffff to indicate a new
session from the server's perspective. The remoteId header specifies the
client's sessionId, all messages back to the client will use this sessionId.
</p>

<p>
The seqNum should be a randomly chosen number between 0 and 0xffff, which
becomes the start of the client sending window - this sequence number must be
the seqNum of the first datagram message sent by the client to server.
</p>


<h2 id="challenge">Challenge</h2>

<p>
Once a hello message has been received, the server assigns a randomly chosen,
unused sessionId and then returns a challenge message. The remoteId header of
the challenge contains the server side's newly assigned session identifier. The
sessionId of the challenge message is the value of the hello's remoteId header.
</p>

<p>
The seqNum should be randomly chosen between 0 and 0xffff - this becomes the
start of the server's sending window - the first datagram sent by the server to
the client must use this seqNum.
</p>

<p>
The following header fields apply:
</p>

<ul>
<li><b>remoteId</b> (required): the server's sessionId to use for messages sent
by the client to the server.</li>

<li><b>digestAlgorithm</b> (optional): this specifies the digest algorithm to
use for hashing the username, password, and nonce returned by the authenticate
message. If this field is unspecified, then "SHA-1" is assumed. Other values
that might be used are "MD5", "SHA-256", "SHA-384", and "SHA-512".
Implementations are only required to implement "SHA-1", so this field should
only be used when knowledge of client capability is known. Values of this field
should always use upper case.</li>

<li><b>nonce</b> (required): the challenge message is required to specify a
nonce used to generate a secure hash of the username and password. This value
should be randomly generated using a cryptographically strong algorithm. A
nonce should only be used once to prevent replay attacks.</li>

</ul>

<p>
If the server doesn't support the version specified by the client in the hello
message, then it should send the close message with the incompatibleVersion
error code. The close message returned should include the version header field,
which tells the client which version the server does support. The client may
then choose to retry the handshake if supports the server's version.
</p>

<p>
If the server is too busy to allocate a new session, then it should send back a
close with the busy error code.
</p>

<p>
A server can by-pass authentication completely by directly sending back a
welcome message.
</p>


<h2 id="authenticate">Authenticate</h2>

<p>
Once the client receives the challenge message, it has enough information to
generate the authenticate message. Clients never pass user credentials directly
to the server over the network. Instead the client sends the server a digest of
the username, password, and nonce. The algorithm to compute the digest is
defined by the digestAlgorithm field defined in the challenge message (or if
unspecified then SHA-1 is assumed). The following function is used to compute
the digest:
</p>

<pre>
credentials = digestAlgorithm(username + ":" + password)
digest      = digestAlgorithm(credentials + nonce)
</pre>

<p>
First we hash the UTF-8 encoded credentials string, which is the username and
password separated by a single ":" colon character. We call this hash the
credentials. We then run the hash function against the credentials and the
nonce, which produces a one-time use digest. This mechanism permits DASP
enabled devices to avoid storing a password in plain text by storing the
username and only the credentials hash. However a device could store the
username and password directly and compute the credentials hash as needed.
</p>

<p>
Once the client computes the digest, it sends the server the authenticate
message. The authenticate message uses the sessionId specified in the
challenge's remoteId header. The seqNum should be the same as that used by the
hello message.
</p>

<p>
The following header fields apply:
</p>

<ul>
<li><b>username</b> (required): the UTF-8 encoded string identifier of the user
to authenticate.</li>

<li><b>digest</b> (required): the message digest hash computed from the
algorithm described above. If using SHA-1, this will be list of 20 bytes
(160-bit digest).</li>
</ul>

<p>
If the client does not support the digest algorithm specified by the server's
challenge message, then the client should immediately send the server a close
message with the digestNotSupported error code.
</p>

<h2 id="welcome">Welcome</h2>

<p>
Once the server receives the authenticate message, it validates the username
and digest against its user database. If the authentication is successful, then
the server responds to the client with the welcome message type. The sessionId
of the welcome is the remoteId specified by the client in its hello. The seqNum
should be the same as that used by the server's challenge message.
</p>

<p>
The following fields apply:
</p>

<ul>
<li><b>idealMax</b> (optional): the ideal maximum of bytes per message from the
server perspective - see Tuning. If not specified 512 is assumed.</li>

<li><b>absMax</b> (optional): the absolute maximum of bytes per message from
the server perspective - see Tuning. If not specified 512 is assumed.</li>

<li><b>receiveMax</b> (optional): the absolute maximum size of the server's
receiving windowing (number of messages). If not specified, then a window size
of 31 messages is assumed.</li>

<li><b>receiveTimeout</b> (optional): the number of seconds that may elapse
without receiving a message before the session is timed out from server
perspective; if not specified then a default of 30 seconds is assumed.</li>

<li><b>remoteId</b>: if we are skipping the challenge, then the server's
sessionId must be returned in the welcome, otherwise this header must be
omitted.</li>
</ul>

<p>
If authentication fails, then the server sends the client back a close message
with the notAuthenticated error code.
</p>

<h2 id="tuning">Tuning</h2>

<p>
The absMax and idealMax header fields are used to negotiate message sizes
between the client and server. The absMax is the absolute maximum number of
bytes that a message may contain including the DASP headers, but not the
transport headers (such as the UDP headers themselves). Typically this value
maps to the amount of buffer space a device can dedicate to processing DASP
messages. For example a device that can only allocate 256 bytes to buffering
an DASP message will not be able to handle larger messages.
</p>

<p>
The idealMax header field specifies the ideal maximum number of bytes a message
should contain including the DASP headers (not including the transport
headers). Often DASP is running over a network like 6LoWPAN that can support
UDP packets larger than the MTU of a 802.15.4 frame. However if implementing a
protocol like file transfer, it is desirable to chunk the stream such that
messages fit within individual 802.15.4 frames without additional fragmentation
overhead. The idealMax header provides for this optimization.
</p>

<p>
Both absMax and idealMax negotiation works the same way. The client specifies
its absMax and idealMax fields in its hello message. If either of the header
fields are omitted, then they are implied to be 512 bytes. The server has its
own absMax and idealMax, which it returns in the welcome message (or else they
default to 512). The actual absMax and idealMax used for the session is the
minimum between the client and server. For example:
</p>

<pre>
client: absMax=512, idealMax=256
server: absMax=1024, idealMax=64
session: absMax=512, idealMax=64
</pre>

<h2 id="errorHandling">Error Handling</h2>

<p>
Because we assume DASP runs over an unreliable transport, implementations must
be prepared to handle lost, delayed, or unordered messages during the handshake
process. The following are specific conditions that may arise, and the recommended
action for each:
</p>

<p>
<b>The client sends the hello, but does not receive the challenge.</b> In this case,
either the hello or the challenge may have been lost. In either case, a new
hello request should be sent. If after three attempts fail, then the client
should assume communication with the server is not available
</p>

<p>
<b>The server sends the challenge, but doesn't receive an authenticate message.</b> In
this case, either the challenge or the authenticate message might have been
dropped. In either case the server should never attempt resending the
challenge, but rather should time out the session if no authenticate is
received. During the handshake process, the server should use a shortened time
out period (compared to normal session communication).
</p>

<p>
<b>The client sends the authenticate, but does not receive the welcome.</b> In this
case, either the authenticate or the welcome message was lost. The client
should resend the authenticate message two more times, before giving up.
Servers should gracefully handle receiving multiple authenticate messages for
the same session.
</p>

<!-- /////////////////////////////////////////////////////// -->
<h1 id="messaging">Messaging</h1>
<!-- /////////////////////////////////////////////////////// -->

<p>
Once the session has successfully been established, either end point may
initiate application level messaging via the datagram message type. When an
endpoint receives a datagram message it performs the following steps:
</p>

<ol>
<li>Matches the sessionId to a valid session. If not a valid session, the
request is ignored.</li>

<li>Checks that the remote address matches the one used to setup the session.
If not the request is ignored.</li>

<li>Checks that the seqNum is within the valid receiving sliding window,
otherwise it is ignored.</li>

<li>Checks that the datagram hasn't already been processed, otherwise it is
ignored. Each endpoint must keep track of messages it has already processed
within its receiving window.</li>

<li>Updates its receiving window</li>

<li>Sends the datagram  to the application layer for processing.</li>

<li>Receiver eventually piggybacks an ack on an outgoing message</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="acks">Acks</h2>

<p>
In order to provide reliability, datagrams have to be acknowledged. If there
are outgoing messages, then the ack header should be piggybacked to avoid extra
messaging. Otherwise a keepAlive message with an ack header is sent back to the
remote endpoint to acknowledge the datagrams received so far. The ack header
specifies the most recent seqNum successfully received. When an ack header is
received, an endpoint can assume that all seqNums &lt;= ackNum have been
successfully received and that ackNum+1 has not been received yet by the remote
endpoint.
</p>

<p>
If an endpoint has received messages with gaps in the sequence numbering, it
can use the ackMore header to enumerate the seqNums it has received. This
allows us to avoid resending those messages just because we've had partial
failures. The ackMore is encoded as a list of bits that indicate messages
received (bit is set), and messages not received (bit is zero). The least
significant bit corresponds to the seqNum in the ack header, and the most
significant bit n corresponds to ackNum+n. The ackMore header must always be
accompanied by the ack header. By definition the least significant bit of the
bitmask must always be one since it corresponds to ackNum itself. Some
examples:
</p>

<pre>
ack=10 ackMore=15          -> 0x21
ack=10 ackMore=12, 13      -> 0x0d
ack=10 ackMore=15, 18, 19  -> 0x03 0x21
</pre>

<h2 id="retries">Retries</h2>

<p>
<font color='red'>Note: the following behavior is not currently implemented
in the opensource Sedona Framework implementations of DASP.</font>
</p>

<p>
Once an endpoint has sent a datagram message, it should wait for a period of
time called the <i>sendRetry</i> (default = 1 sec) (see <a href='#flowControl'>Flow Control</a>
for details). If no acknowledgement has been received for the datagram's
seqNum, then one of two things has happened: the original datagram was lost or
the acknowledgement was lost.   The endpoint should resend the datagram message
with the original sequence number, then wait again for sendRetry period.  This process
should be repeated until the datagram has been sent the number of times specified
by the <i>maxSend</i> (default = 3) parameter. If the maxSend attempt fails, then
the session should be timed out and the close message sent to the remote endpoint
with the timeout error code.
</p>

<h2 id="slidingWindow">Sliding Window</h2>

<p>
DASP supports full duplex messaging - either side may initiate application
messages, which are identified with a 16-bit sequence number. An endpoint can
have multiple outstanding messages that have not been acknowledged. The
sequence of unacknowledged messages sent is called the <i>sending window</i>.
</p>

<p>
Each endpoint also maintains a <i>receiving window</i>, which is the
sequence of messages it is prepared to receive. Any messages outside of the
receiving window are ignored. The receiveMax header is used to communicate the
maximum size of receiving window so that the remote endpoint can tune its
sending window. The receiveMax header of the client is specified in its hello
message, and the receiveMax of the server is specified in the welcome message.
Once receiveMax is established during the handshake, it cannot be changed.
</p>

<p>
The receiveMax header specifies the maximum size of the sliding window, since
any messages outside of that window will be ignored. An endpoint should never
use a sending window size greater than the remote endpoint's receiving window.
However, often the sending window is smaller than the remote's receive window.
The sending window is grown and shrunk during the lifetime of the session to
allow dynamic optimization of the session's throughput. Tuning the size of the
sending window is the basis for flow control and congestion control.
</p>

<p>
Since seqNum is stored in an unsigned 16-bit integer, implementations must
handle rollover. The seqNum 65535 is followed by the sequence number 0. For
example given lower bound of 65530 and a window size of 10, then the window
wraps from 65530 to 3 inclusively.
</p>

<p>
Sequence numbers and the sliding window are only used for datagram messages.
The client's handshake hello and authenticate messages define the client's
starting sequence number, which is the seqNum of the client's first datagram.
The server's handshake challenge and welcome define the sequence number of the
server's first datagram. The close and keepAlive messages should always use a
sequence number of 0xffff.
</p>

<!-- /////////////////////////////////////////////////////// -->
<h1 id="flowControl">Flow Control</h1>
<!-- /////////////////////////////////////////////////////// -->

<p>
A primary goal for DASP is to provide communication for traffic spanning
networks and devices of varying capabilities. For example a common use case is
a PC on an Ethernet network communicating to a low cost device on a 6LoWPAN
network. The ability to tune a session's communication rates based on the
capability of the endpoints is called <i>flow control</i>.
</p>

<p>
It is also common for traffic on networks to vary over time during the course
of a session. Tuning the session to handle varying network loads is called
<i>congestion control</i>. For practical purposes, flow control and congestion
control are handled using the same mechanisms - so we will use the term flow
control generically.
</p>

<p>
Flow control in DASP is always managed on the sending side by dynamically
tuning the size of the sending window and the sendRetry time. These values are
tuned based on analysis of the session's recent past performance.
</p>

<!-- /////////////////////////////////////////////////////// -->
<h1 id="keepAlive">Keep Alive and Termination</h1>
<!-- /////////////////////////////////////////////////////// -->

<p>
A session is terminated via one of the following conditions:
</p>

<ul>
<li>One endpoint sends the close message</li>
<li>No packets are received after a timeout period</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="close">Close</h2>

<p>
If possible, sessions should be gracefully shutdown using the close message
type. If the failure is in the DASP layer (as opposed to the application
layer), then the errorCode header should be specified.
</p>

<p>
If an endpoint receives either the close or error message types, then the
session is immediately terminated and the sessionId invalidated. No
acknowledgement is sent on close messages.
</p>

<p>
It is recommended that close messages be sent twice - endpoints should
automatically ignore duplicate close/errors because the sessionId will be
invalid. Errors during the handshake should only be sent once. However, since
there is no acknowledgment, we can never guarantee that both endpoints are
aware of the session termination (in which case we must rely on timeouts).
</p>

<h2 id="timeout">Timeout</h2>

<p>
We can never assume that sessions are closed gracefully, because real-world
applications and networks can't be trusted. If an endpoint has not received any
messages after a period of time, then the session is timed out. A timed out
session is terminated and the sessionId is invalidated. The endpoint should
send the remote endpoint an close message with the timeout error code - this
error should only be sent once since there is a good chance the remote endpoint
is no longer available.
</p>

<p>
Each endpoint specifies its configured timeout via the receiveTimeout header.
The client specifies receiveTimeout in its hello message, and the server in the
welcome message. If the receiveTimeout is omitted during the handshake, then 30
sec should be assumed. Once the session is established the overall timeout of
the session is the maximum timeout between the client and the server. Both
endpoints must then use the longer timeout.
</p>

<p>
Because the timeout must be negotiated between the endpoints, care should be
taken with using very long time outs. The longer timeout is used because we
assume the less capable endpoint's network or device drives overall reliability
and speed. However longer timeouts also mean longer periods where the critical
memory resources of session state are tied up waiting for a session timeout.

<p>
The keepAlive message type is used to prevent session timeouts and carry
acknowledgments when there are no outgoing application messages.
</p>

<p>
If there are no outgoing datagram messages to piggyback an ack header, then an
endpoint should sent a keepAlive to acknowledge received messages.
Implementations can send these acknowledgements immediately or may use a small
delay called the <i>ackDelay</i>. The ackDelay provides a period of time
to coalesce multiple acknowledgements and wait for an outgoing datagram message
to be generated.
</p>

<p>
Even if all received messages have been acknowledged, then an endpoint still
needs to send keepAlive messages to ensure that the remote endpoint doesn't
timeout the session. In the absence of other messaging, an endpoint should send
keepAlives three times as fast as the timeout period. For example if the
negotiated timeout is 30 sec, then keepAlives should be sent every 10 sec. Keep
alives should only be used when no application datagrams are being transmitted.
</p>

<p>
KeepAlives are themselves never part of the sliding window. The seqNum of a
keepAlives should be 0xffff. When a keep alive is received, it is never checked
against the receiving window and is never acknowledged. An endpoint that sends
a keepAlive should never attempt to retry the keepAlive, since no
acknowledgement is expected.

<!-- /////////////////////////////////////////////////////// -->

<p>
DASP supports device discovery with the following sequence:
</p>

<ol>
<li>The client sends a discover request to all listening Sedona servers</li>
<li>Any server that receives the discover request opens a Sox session</li>
<li>The server then sends a discover response containing its platform ID </li>
<li>The server closes the Sox session immediately</li>
</ol>

<p>
Each discover response the client receives is added to a list of discovered nodes.
</p>

<h2 id="discover">Discover</h2>

<p>
A discover message may be sent by a client or a server.  The client sends a discover
message with no header fields.  The server's response message is identical except that
it adds a single header field containing its platform ID.
</p>

<ul>
  <li><b>platformId</b> (response only): a string containing the platform ID of the
  responding device. </li>
</ul>

<p>
How the discovered devices are collected and processed is not specified.
