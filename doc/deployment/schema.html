<!-- /////////////////////////////////////////////////////// -->

<p>
Because the Sedona Framework is designed to work in very constrained embedded
environments, we have to make design tradeoffs.  One of the biggest
tradeoffs is using a low level binary format for Sedona Framework application
files and the Sox protocol.  This compact form requires out-of-band
information for encoding and decoding.
</p>
<p>
For example the binary format does not contain kit, type, or slot definitions,
only their numeric ids.  So in order to reconstruct the original app from its binary
SAB file, we must have some external way to map those ids to the right definitions.
Correct versioning is also important, since kits may evolve
over time to include new types and new slots which could change their ids.
The schema tells us how to create the right mapping for the app, by
specifying the kit versions and checksums that were used to create the app.
</p>

<!-- /////////////////////////////////////////////////////// -->
<h1 id="checksums">Kit Parts</h1>
<!-- /////////////////////////////////////////////////////// -->

<p>
Every kit contains zero or more named types.  Each type declares
zero or more slots.  For a given version of a kit, there is a fixed
list of types and their declared slots.  Each slot has a fixed
name, flags, and type.  When a kit is compiled from source into
a kit zip file, the compiler generates a <i>checksum</i> for this fixed
list of types and slots.  The combination of a kit name and checksum
is called a <i>kit part</i>.
</p>

<p id="manifest">
The kit meta-data, checksum, and list of types and slots is included
in the kit file as an XML file called "manifest.xml".  Here is an example manifest file:
</p>

<pre>
&lt;?xml version='1.0'?&gt;
&lt;kitManifest
   name="sysTest"
   checksum="da52f78f"
   version="1.0"
   vendor="Tridium"
   description="Test suite for core language and sys APIs"
   buildHost="BLAZE"
   buildTime="2007-05-17T16:21:08.030-04:00"
&gt;

&lt;type id="0" name="AbstractTestComp" base="sys::Component"&gt;
  &lt;slot id="0" name="az" type="bool"/&gt;
  &lt;slot id="1" name="ai" type="int"/&gt;
&lt;/type&gt;

&lt;type id="1" name="TestComp" base="sysTest::AbstractTestComp"&gt;
  &lt;slot id="0" name="z1" type="bool"/&gt;
  &lt;slot id="1" name="b1" type="byte"/&gt;
  &lt;slot id="2" name="addF1" type="float" flags="a"/&gt;
&lt;/type&gt;

&lt;type id="2" name="SubTestComp" base="sysTest::TestComp"&gt;
  &lt;slot id="0" name="sb" type="byte"/&gt;
  &lt;slot id="1" name="si" type="int"/&gt;
&lt;/type&gt;

&lt;/kitManifest&gt;
</pre>

<p>
The checksum is based only on the kit's component types (those that
subclass <code>sys::Component</code>) and slots.
The checksum is not based on variable meta-data such as the kit's version number,
or on non-component types which could never appear in an app definition.
This means that multiple versions of the same kit might share the same checksum
if no component types or slots have been modified between versions.
</p>
<p>
Don't confuse <b>version</b> with <b>checksum</b>.
Version represents a revision of the whole kit including its
code, algorithms, and when it was built; the version only changes when
the developer <i>chooses</i> to specify a different version number.
Checksum represents a revision of the declared types and slots, and it
changes <i>automatically</i> whenever the type or slot definitions change.
</p>

<!-- /////////////////////////////////////////////////////// -->
<h1 id="kitDb">Kit Database</h1>
<!-- /////////////////////////////////////////////////////// -->

<p>
Within a Sedona Framework installation we store all the local copies of
kits with the file pattern:
<code>{Sedona home}/kits/{kit}/{kit}-{checksum}-{version}.kit</code>
For example:
</p>

<pre>
{Sedona home}/
  kits/
    control/
      control-cdf5f0f0-1.0.28.kit
      control-cdf5f0f0-1.0.29.kit
      control-1239c0de-1.0.29.kit

    sys/
      sys-ef94b11d-1.0.28.kit
    .
    .
    .
</pre>

<p>
We call this directory the <i>kit database</i>.  It can store
multiple versions of each kit with different checksums.
The <code>sedona.kit.*</code> Java APIs can be used to work with the kit database.
</p>

<!-- /////////////////////////////////////////////////////// -->
<h1 id="manifestDb">Manifest Database</h1>
<!-- /////////////////////////////////////////////////////// -->

<p>
Kit files contain all the information we need when working with schema.
However, to interface with a device that is using a kit we don't need the full
kit file, only the XML manifest file that represents it.
So in addition to the kit database, we also create a <i>manifest database</i> with
the file pattern: <code>{Sedona home}/manifests/{kit}/{kit}-{checksum}.xml</code>
For example:
</p>

<pre>
{Sedona home}/
  manifests/
    control/
      control-cdf5f0f0.xml
      control-1239c0de.xml

    sys/
      sys-ef94b11d.xml
    .
    .
    .
</pre>

<p>
By storing the manifests in a separate database, we don't
need to use the kit files themselves to work with the kits' types.
This is typically more efficient, and in addition it allows a vendor to
publish just the manifests for their kits as opposed to entire kit files.
</p>
<p>
Note, however, that manifests cannot be used to create an SCode image.
Building an SCode image requires access to the actual kit files.
</p>

<p>
The <code>sedona.manifest.*</code> APIs are used to work with manifests
and the manifest database via the Java toolkit.  The <code>KitManifest</code>
class represents the information stored a kit manifest file and provides
methods for encoding and decoding from XML.  The <code>ManifestDb</code>
class is used to load and save <code>KitManifest</code>s to the file
system.
</p>

<!-- /////////////////////////////////////////////////////// -->
<h1 id="schemas">Schemas</h1>
<!-- /////////////////////////////////////////////////////// -->

<p>
A Sedona Framework application is composed of multiple kits.
A specific list of kit parts (kits at a specific checksum
revision) is called a <i>schema</i>.  Matching schemas guarantee
compatibility between the app running on the device and the app's
representation elsewhere, such as in a PC-based tool.
</p>

<p>
Only when a kit manifest is accessed for a specific schema can we correctly
interpret binary information such as kit id and slot id.  For example the kit
id for the "control" kit might be 3 in one schema, but 5 in another schema
that has a different list of kit parts.  Slot ids for a given kit part can
also change across schemas, if there are changes to slots inherited
from base types.
</p>

<p>
The Java API for working with schemas is in <code>sedona.*</code>.
Schemas are built with the <code>sedona.Schema</code>
class from a list of <code>KitParts</code> which are resolved against
the manifest database.  Assuming all the kit parts can be resolved to
kit manifests, we can build a complete representation of the schema
including the full list of kits, types, and slots along with
their respective ids.  The <code>Schema</code> is then used
to work with binary formats such as ".sab" files and Sox messages.
</p>

<!-- /////////////////////////////////////////////////////// -->
<h1 id="kitsVsManifests">Kits versus Manifests</h1>
<!-- /////////////////////////////////////////////////////// -->

<p>
So when do you need a kit and when do you only need a manifest?
This table helps summarize the differences:
</p>

<table>

<tr>
  <th></th>
  <th>Encapsulates</th>
  <th>Versioned By</th>
  <th>Uses</th>
</tr>

<tr>
  <th>Manifest</th>
  <td>type and slot schema</td>
  <td>checksum</td>
  <td>sax, sab, and sox</td>
</tr>

<tr>
  <th>Kit</th>
  <td>code</td>
  <td>version number</td>
  <td>compiling dependencies and scode images</td>
</tr>

</table>

<p>
For example when working with an application file or Sox, only
the type schemas are needed.  No knowledge of the internal code
is required.  However when compiling, you need the full kit that
contains the actual code.
So a manifest is somewhat analogous to a C header
file, which declares function prototypes but does not contain any
code for the functions.
</p>

<p>
Manifests are versioned with a checksum each time a type or
slot definition is modified.  Kits are versioned with a version
number typically whenever code is modified.
</p>

<!-- /////////////////////////////////////////////////////// -->
<h1 id="resolvingManifests">Resolving Manifests</h1>
<!-- /////////////////////////////////////////////////////// -->

<p>
To fully connect to a remote Sedona device, there must be local copies
of the kit manifests corresponding to the device's current schema.
The recommended rules for locating each kit manifest are:
</p>

<ol>
<li>Check the local manifest database first; if the manifest is found then use it</li>
<li>Check the local kit database for the given kit, if found then extract the manifest
file and store it in the local manifest database</li>
<li>Download the manifest from sedonadev.org to the local manifest database</li>
</ol>

<p>
These steps are automatically implemented by the Sedona <code>ManifestDb</code> API.
If any manifests required by the schema are not found a
<code>MissingKitManifestException</code> is thrown, which contains information about
the specific manifests that are missing.
This information can be used to compose a friendly error message to the user
about why the connection failed, or to request the missing file(s) from the
device itself (see next section).
</p>

<!-- /////////////////////////////////////////////////////// -->
<h1 id="mfServer">Kit Manifest Server</h1>
<!-- /////////////////////////////////////////////////////// -->

<p>
Beginning with Sedona 1.2, the Sedona Sox Client supports retrieving missing
manifest files from the remote Sedona device itself.
If it detects the <code>MissingKitManifestException</code> when resolving the
device's schema locally, it requests the missing manifests from the device.
If the device is set up to serve the requested manifests it will send them.
This feature can make it easier to deploy new devices,
as they can be shipped with the necessary manifests installed on the device
rather than requiring them to be installed separately in advance on
the Sox Client host.
</p>
<p>
Serving kit manifests is accomplished very simply, using a special filename prefix
called a <i>scheme</i> to indicate to the device where to look for the file in its local
file system.
This allows the manifest retrieval to be accomplished using the regular Sox file
transfer protocol.  When the Sox Client detects that a manifest is not found by
the usual rules described above, it sends a Sox "get file" request to the device
using the filename of the missing manifest adding the appropriate scheme prefix.
When the device receives the request, it recognizes by the prefix that this is a
manifest file, and looks in its local database for the one requested.
If the file is found, it sends it via Sox back to the requesting client.
</p>

<!-- /////////////////////////////////////////////////////// -->
<h2 id="mfServerImpl">Implementation Details</h2>
<!-- /////////////////////////////////////////////////////// -->

<p>
To make this feature work on a given Sedona platform, the following things
must be true:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>The required manifest file(s) must be stored on the device</li>
  <li>The "<b>m:</b>" scheme must be implemented on the remote Sedona device
  (see below)</li>
  <li>The <code>sedonadev.autodownload</code> property in sedona.properties
  must be set to false, or omitted entirely</li>
</ul>

<p>
A <i>scheme</i> is simply a prefix to the filename, such as "m:", which is
translated on the remote device into a local path where the file should be located.
There are two ways to implement a scheme:
</p>

<ol>
  <li>It can be implemented entirely at the native level, encapsulated in the
  appropriate <code>sys::FileStore</code> natives</li>
  <li>It can be implemented at the Sedona level using a platform-specific
   FileStore subclass.</li>
</ol>

<p>
If it is implemented at the native level, then at the Sedona level the device
treats the prefix as part of the actual filename.  The native implementation
of <code>FileStore.doOpen()</code> must then
strip off the prefix and substitute the path to the local manifest database.
The resulting full path to the file is then passed to the local file system
and handled just like any other file transfer request.
</p>

<p>
If it is implemented using a FileStore subclass, then the FileStore subclass
should override the <code>accept()</code> method such that it returns true if
the filename begins with the desired prefix.
Then the <code>open()</code> method can be overridden to strip off the scheme
prefix and substitute the desired path, or the FileStore subclass may have an
additional native method that provides the appropriate path for all files in
that scheme.
</p>

<p>
The Sedona 1.2 open source includes a class in the 'win32' platform kit,
called <code>Win32ProvDbFileStore</code>.  This class demonstrates the
second (Sedona-level) implementation strategy described above.
</p>

<p>
N.B. An ambitious Sedona developer could use this same strategy to provide
kit files and/or platform manifests as well as kit manifests.

<p>
To summarize the schema pipeline:
</p>

<ol>
  <li><b>Checksum</b>: Generated by the compiler when compiling a kit
  file from source, the checksum is based on the declared types
and slots in the kit.</li>

<li><b>Kit Part</b>: The combination of kit name and kit
checksum that uniquely identifies a kit for a specific schema
revision.</li>

<li><b>Kit Manifest</b>: A file containing a kit's checksum
and type definitions, stored as a zip archive entry named "manifest.xml".
</li>

<li><b>Kit Database</b>: A local database of kit versions,
created and maintained by the Sedona Framework Java toolkit.  </li>

<li><b>Manifest Database</b>: A local database of all the kit manifests that
have been accumulated, created, and maintained by the Sedona Framework Java toolkit.
These manifests are XML files keyed by kit name and checksum.</li>

<li><b>Schema</b>: A list of kit parts aggregated by the Sedona Framework Java toolkit.
A schema defines the full meta-data required to work with binary format
entities with matching schemas.
Each Sedona Framework runtime and application file has a single, fixed schema.
The Java toolkit models schemas via the <code>sedona.Schema</code> API.</li>
