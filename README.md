# Sedona [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/linsong/sedona.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/linsong/sedona) [![Join the chat at https://gitter.im/linsong/sedona](https://badges.gitter.im/Join%20Chat.svg)](https://gitter.im/linsong/sedona?utm_source=badge&utm_medium=badge&utm_campaign=pr-badge&utm_content=badge)



The Sedona framework is designed to make it easy to build smart, networked embedded devices. 

This is a fork of the [official Sedona framework](http://www.sedonadev.org), we call it as **Sedona community branch**. Here's why we decided to fork:
* We love the Sedona framework and want it to become better and better, but there is no updates in years in the [official branch](http://www.sedonadev.org). So we make a branch here for everyone in the community to contribute; and at the same time, the whole community can get benifits from these contributions. **From the community, to the community**.
* We love git over Mercurial version control system, so we chose github :)

We use [Academic Free License("AFL")](http://www.sedonadev.org/doc/license.html), the same as the official Sedona framework. You can visit the official site for more details: http://www.sedonadev.org.

## How To Build
### Mac OS X 
1. make sure Xcode command line tools installed. you can run following command in terminal to install it:
```
 $ xcode-select --install
```
2. in terminal window, go to sedona's folder and initialize the build environment:
```
 $ cd /path/to/sedona/src && source adm/unix/init.sh 
```
3. in terminal window, start to build sedona zipball:
```
 $ ./adm/makedist.py
```

### GNU/Linux
We build a shell script that uses docker to build sedona under linux, read [here](./tools/README.md) for more details.

### Customize build platform
If it's necessary to cross-compile sedona to custom platform with own set of additional or modified kits, please follow instructions described [here](./adm/CustomBuild.md).
